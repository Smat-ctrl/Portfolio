Working in a real academic environment showed me something important: **technology only matters when it helps real people.**  
Every student, every department, and every community partner relies on systems we build — and building those systems taught me how much I love solving meaningful, human-centred problems.

This is the story of how I contributed to Sheridan College’s digital operations as a **Digital Developer**.

### What I Worked On

Sheridan operates across **various campuses** with thousands of students. My work focused on improving the digital experience for students, staff, and internal departments. I helped create tools that supported:

- student onboarding
- internal workflows
- communication systems
- data tracking and reporting
- community partnerships

My role combined development, problem-solving, and design — allowing me to bring ideas from _concept_ to _implementation_.

### Building Digital Solutions for Sheridan

My work wasn’t just “maintenance” — I was actively building and improving real systems used across the college.

I collaborated with multiple departments to design tools that solved specific operational problems. This included developing internal ticketing systesm (Zoho Desk implementations), improving student-facing forms and workflows (Articulate rise 360), and ensuring data was properly structured, validated, and accessible.

I was often given a problem, a set of requirements, or a workflow that needed fixing — and it was up to me to **design the solution**, build it, and ensure it actually worked for the end-users.

### Process of Building

Working in an academic institution means different teams depend on your work — so reliability, clarity, and communication matter just as much as the code.

As a Digital Developer, I:

- gathered requirements from staff and faculty
- turned workflows into functional digital tools
- built user-friendly interfaces based on their needs
- automated manual tasks that previously took hours
- tested systems with real users and iterated fast
- wrote clear documentation for long-term maintainability

I learned quickly that **every digital problem has a human behind it**, and that shaped how I approached everything I built.

### Tech Stack & Development Practices

While different tasks required different tools, I consistently focused on:

- clean and maintainable code
- scalable data structures
- secure handling of student and internal information
- intuitive and accessible UI/UX
- efficiency and performance
- documentation for future teams

These practices helped ensure the systems I built would continue working long after my internship ended.

### Launching Internal Tools

Because the systems I built were used by staff across campuses, launches had to be smooth.  
Each time I completed a tool, I:

- deployed it through internal pipelines
- verified data flow and database connectivity
- handled bug fixes quickly
- ensured no disruption to existing workflows
- walked teams through onboarding and usage

I learned how to ship features that people depended on — not just something that “worked on my machine.”

### Learnings

Working at Sheridan changed my perspective on development. It taught me that:

- **clear communication** is just as important as the code
- solutions must be built around real people and real problems
- small improvements can make a huge impact for large groups
- you don’t need to be perfect — you just need to keep learning and adapting

My experience showed me that I’m passionate about **creating tools that make people’s lives easier**, and that’s ultimately why I chose to pursue computer science.
